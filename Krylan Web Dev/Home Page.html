      <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Krylen Taxi Services was established in September 2020 by Ms Lavinia Pitalot as a taxi company targeted at providing reliable and safe transportation for women in Port Moresby. However, with word spreading, men too see why Krylen is and will be the most sought-for transportation company in PNG. </p>
        <p>Although it has only been months since it’s inauguration, Krylen has grown and is quickly becoming one of POM city’s most dependable and safest transport companies. Krylen’s vision is to become a national transport brand that all industry clients can identify with; the rest of PNG can recognize that Krylen thrives on reliability, honesty and quality. </p>
    <br>
      <h2>A word from the MD</h2>
        <p>“It is an extreme honor to be part of the driving force of Krylen especially highlighting the fact that it is and will continue to be my brain child. Krylen Taxi Services was established in September 2020 as a taxi company targeted at providing reliable and safe transportation for women in Port Moresby. However, with word spreading, men too see why Krylen is and will be the most sought-for transportation company in PNG.”</p>
        <p>“Growing up in Port Moresby, there have been numerous occasions where girls and women have been harassed in public transport. These stories along with other tales are the reason for my pursuing a taxi company so girls and women would feel safe knowing that a woman has hand-picked some of the most trusted drivers to take them to their destination at an affordable rate; safely without fear.”</p>
        <p>We have a fleet comprised of executive sedans and a Rav 4 and all these vehicles have trackers and panic buttons installed.</p>
